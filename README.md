# Overview
This project aims to analyze and understand customer purchase behavior using Python, with a focus on data manipulation and visualization techniques. 
The primary libraries used for this analysis include Pandas, Seaborn, and descriptive statistics.

# Analysis
The analysis is centered around understanding customer purchase behavior. Using Pandas, we perform data manipulations to derive meaningful metrics such as average purchase amount, frequency of purchases, and customer demographics. Seaborn is employed for creating visualizations that help illustrate patterns and trends in the data. 
Descriptive statistics are utilized to gain insights into the central tendencies and variability of the purchase data.
